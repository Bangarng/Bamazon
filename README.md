#MySQL Database Setup
In order to run this application, you need to install the MySQL database to your machine. Once you have MySQL installed, create the Bamazon database and the products table with the SQL code found in Bamazon.sql. Run this code inside your MySQL. For this project I used MySQL Workbench, which can be found here: https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/
